Workstations at Leiden Observatory use tcsh while my mac uses bash as default shell. (`echo $SHELL` to see the shell you are currently using). And I was informed by the people from computer desk that it is suggested to use tcsh instead user defined shell to access the full functionality of workstations in the Observatory.

.alias: I move all my aliases in .alias file and make a softlink .alias -> .config/.alias in home directory.
.settings: Enviroment settings and other settings are here with tcsh language.
.gitprompt.csh: Mimic the prompt on my mac terminal.

.config/.alias and .config/.settings have their softlinks under home diretory. ${HOME}/.tcshrc will call them.
